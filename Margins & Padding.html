    <P>Many students in Yabatech, especially new students, have many issues, which they are dissatisfied with, but they keep these issues bottled down because they do not have a means of laying their complaints, and even when they do, it takes long time for them to receive a reply, sometimes they never receive a reply at all, and most of the time, these issues end up becoming serious problems for them because the complaint system is manual.</P>
