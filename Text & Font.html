      In order to have an effective educational system Yaba College of Technology, there are some issues in the environment that need to be properly addressed. An example is the issue of complaints management system in our school. This issue has created a lot of problems for growth in various aspects of the educational system in the past. In order to support this approach, this project identifies a solution that can be used to manage and resolve all kinds of complaints. This includes the need for an administrator to make every effort to resolve potential or actual complaints as informally as possible in the first instance. Handling complaints involve listening, understanding, offering a solution, executing the solution, and then following up. According to Collins English Dictionary, a complaint is a statement in which you express your dissatisfaction with a particular situation. Many students, especially new students, have many issues, which they are dissatisfied with, but they keep these issues bottled down because they do not have a means of laying their complaints, and even when they do, it takes long time for them to receive a reply, sometimes they never receive a reply at all. Most of the time, these issues end up becoming serious problems for them. As students advance in their academics, there tends to be more complicated issues surrounding their academics, from course registrations to information gathering. In order to understand better the kind of complaints students have, we carried out a simple survey through oral interviews. About twenty students were interviewed from different faculties in the school.
